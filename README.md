# PgmUsr quick explain

So we are learning a little bit of Haskell and we decided to scatch our heads defining a program that any other programming language does in lightspeed :-)

The goal is to setup a basic program that, given an input (txt file) containing some lines (i.e. the `ps -aux` cmd output)
returns to StdOut a parsed and sorted list of the items we really care about.
In our example, the input was containing a matrix containing 4 key values "PID" "Path" "PGname" and "UUID".
